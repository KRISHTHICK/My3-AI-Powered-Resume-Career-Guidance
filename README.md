Here’s a complete idea for a different topic project that includes all the features you're asking for:

## 🔍 Project: **"A2A Career Coach: AI-Powered Resume & Career Guidance Assistant"**

### 💡 Overview:
This app allows users to upload their resume (PDF), then ask career-related questions (e.g., “What roles am I suited for?” or “Suggest improvements to my resume”). It uses Ollama (LLM) + A2A (Ask-to-Ask design) + Streamlit + Python — runs easily in VS Code and can be pushed to GitHub.

### ✅ Features:
- Upload resume in PDF
- Extract text from PDF
- Ask questions about the resume
- AI suggests job roles, improvements, and skills
- Built-in blog generation about resume improvements
- Visual insights on skills mentioned
- No external Linux-only dependencies (no `poppler`, `tesseract`, etc.)
